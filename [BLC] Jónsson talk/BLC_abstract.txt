Jónsson Cardinals: a deceptive large cardinal notion

Does every structure have a proper elementary substructure of the same size?
This question --- whose answer is false --- led to the notion of a Jónsson
cardinal, being the cardinals for which this is true. These cardinals turn out
to exhibit strange behaviour compared to other large cardinals, as the theory
"ZFC + there is a Jónsson cardinal" is quite strong, but a Jónsson cardinal
itself is ostensibly very weak in terms of direct implication. I will talk a
bit about this asymmetry in strength and zoom in on the problem of determining
the direct implication strength, leading to a special relationship between
Jónsson cardinals and weakly compact cardinals.
