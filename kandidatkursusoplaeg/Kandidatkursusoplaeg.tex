If you're a master's student of Mathematics or becoming one after summer {\normalsize (or just interested in Mathematics!)}, we'd like to help you with your choice of courses in block 1 and 2, which you need to sign up for between May 15 and June 1.\\

We're giving talks on a broad selection of the master's courses before the course enrollment period begins, so you have a bit more to base your choice on, now that you have to stick to whatever you sign up for because of the new reform.\\

The talks will be on Fridays in weeks 1 and 3 of block 4. Here's the plan:\\

\begin{tabular}{llll}
  Time & Place & Speaker & Courses\\\hline
  29/4 at 13.15-14.00 & Aud. 3 & Dan & AlgTop and HomAlg\\
  29/4 at 14.15-15.00 & Aud. 3 & Jakob & Alg3 and AlgGeo\\

  13/5 at 14.15-15.00 & Aud. 10 & Mikkel & FunkAn and Geom2
\end{tabular}\\\\

Facebook events: {\color{blue}\texttt{bit.ly/mathtalk1}} and {\color{blue}\texttt{bit.ly/mathtalk2}}.\\

We're looking forward to seeing you!\\
