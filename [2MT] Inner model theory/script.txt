SLIDE 1 - INTRO 

Thank you. So I'm going to talk about something called the Skolem paradox.


SLIDE 2 - THE UNIVERSE

This is the universe, which seems enormous with all its stars, solar systems
and galaxies... but it's still just finite.


SLIDE 3 - OUR UNIVERSE

On the other hand, OUR universe is massive..


SLIDE 4 - THE REALS

.. since we got UNCOUNTABLE objects such as the reals. But what if I told you
that if we have such a mathematical universe then we also got a COUNTABLE such
one.


SLIDE 5 - COUNTABLE UNIVERSE

A place in which all mathematical objects exist and where all theorems can
still be proven - but countable. Remember that being countable means that
we're in bijection with the naturals. But as the countable universe contains
all of maths, surely it contains the naturals as well.


SLIDE 6 - PARADOX

But now we got a mathematical universe in which the reals are countable!
Right? .. No. We simply got a bijection between the naturals and the reals -
I never required the bijection to lie INSIDE the universe. Remember that a
bijection is just a set as well.


SLIDE 7 - SOLUTION

The countable universe therefore still thinks that the reals are uncountable since
it sees no such bijection, but from the outside it's all countable.


SLIDE 8 - MORALE

The morale of the story is then that ALL truth is relative - even mathematical
truth.
