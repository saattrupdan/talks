# Virtual large cardinals

A large cardinal notion defined via elementary embeddings is **virtual** if we only assume that the embeddings exist in a generic extension. This approach started when Schindler ('00) showed that the existence of what later turned out to be a virtually strong cardinal is equiconsistent with the theory of L(R) being unchangeable by proper forcing, and Gitman and Schindler ('18) initiated a proper study of the virtuals. Philipp Schlicht and I are currently continuing this analysis.

We show that, in the virtual world, measurables and strongs are equiconsistent (and thus also to supercompacts as Gitman has shown that strongs and supercompacts are equivalent in the virtual world), and provide game characterisations for some of these cardinals. Further, we perform an analysis on the level-by-level behaviour of the virtuals in terms of direct implication. Many open questions remain.
