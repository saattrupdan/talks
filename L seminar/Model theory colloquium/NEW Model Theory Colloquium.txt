*** MODEL THEORY COLLOQUIUM ***

- Basic stuff
- Completeness theorem
- Compactness theorem (proof w/ completeness theorem)

**Applications**
- T\models\phi => \Delta\models\phi for finite \Delta\subseteq T
- For every prime p, \phi is true in some ACF of char p => C\models\phi
- Every injective polynomial C^n -> C^n is surjective
