- Define:
	- Language (def 5.1)
	- Model (def 5.3)
	- Elementarily equivalent (def 6.9)
	- Partial isomorphism (def 6.11)
	- Back-and-forth property (def 6.11)
	
- Prove:
	- Exist partial isoms between M and N w/ back-n-forth -> M elm.eq. N (prop 6.12)
	- Any two DLO's w/o endpoints are elm.eq. (lemma 6.13)
	- Completeness can't be described in first-order logic (corollary 6.14)
